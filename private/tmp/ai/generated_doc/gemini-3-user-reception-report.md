## Specific Task Performance

### 1. **Coding & Development** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

#### Strengths:
- **Frontend/UI work is exceptional**: "Nails design details, micro-interactions, and responsiveness on the first try"
- **JetBrains reported >50% improvement** over Gemini 2.5 Pro in solved benchmark tasks
- **Complex single-shot prompts** that typically need multiple refinements now work on first attempt
- Successfully generated **entire 3D games** (functional tank game) in a single shot
- **Long-context understanding**: Uses context far more effectively than Gemini 2.5 Pro for "long-horizon coding tasks across entire codebases"
- SVG animations generate perfectly, web designs emerge clean and functional, 3D physics simulations run smoothly

#### "Vibe Coding" Feature:
- Developers can describe outcomes in natural language
- Agent breaks work into steps, writes code, calls tools, reports back
- Works in Cursor and JetBrains integrations

#### Weaknesses:
- **Antigravity IDE requires babysitting**: "Will sometimes glance at a log, declare victory, and move on while your build is still throwing errors"
- May claim success prematurely without confirming actual functionality
- Needs active supervision to catch errors the model misses

### 2. **Creative Writing** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

#### Strengths:
- "Finally good" - doesn't sound like "AI slop" anymore
- User reported: "It wrote book chapters I had to double-check weren't plagiarized from a real book"
- Coherent, natural-paced writing that avoids typical AI patterns
- "Genuinely good writing" rather than "good for AI" work

#### Comparison to Competitors:
- **Many writers still prefer GPT-5.1 or Claude for fiction and highly stylized prose**
- Claude maintains edge in matching specific writing styles and tone

### 3. **Multimodal Tasks** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

#### Image Analysis:
- Successfully extracted detailed benchmark data from complex table images
- Generated comprehensive alt text with all numerical scores
- SVG generation shows "superior anatomical accuracy" compared to competing models

#### Audio Transcription:
- **Tested on 3-hour 33-minute city council meeting**
- Generated speaker identification and structured section summaries
- Well-organized outline with participant names
- **Major weakness**: Significant timestamp inaccuracies (showed 01:04:00 for meeting ending at 3:31:05), making it "much harder to jump to the right point and confirm accuracy"
- **File size limitation**: 74MB file failed with "Internal error," needed compression to 38MB

#### Cost Examples:
- Image analysis: ~$0.057
- Full 3.5-hour audio transcription: $1.42

### 4. **Research & Document Analysis** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

#### Strengths:
- **Massive context window** - processes much more text at once without forgetting
- Users found themselves using Gemini more for "handling large amounts of text"
- Excellent at contextual awareness in math, writing, and code tasks
- Noticeably better at following nuanced instructions

#### Real-World Applications:
- Uploading academic papers to generate interactive flashcards
- Deciphering handwritten recipes in foreign languages to create digital cookbooks
- Analyzing videos of tennis swings to build training plans

### 5. **Math & Reasoning** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

- "Excelled at math, physics and code"
- Improved reasoning was evident in testing - handles logic better than predecessor
- Less prone to hallucinations in multi-step prompts
- Beat competitors at reasoning about UI layout and component structure

---

## Key Characteristics

### Response Style & UX
- **More terse and direct**: "Less ingratiating," gives "the answer and (mostly) stops"
- **Respects your time**: Avoids clichés and flattery
- Acts as a "true thought partner that tells you what you need to hear"
- Smart, concise, and direct responses

### Speed & Consistency
- **"Intelligence per second off the charts"**: Often outperforms GPT-5 Pro without the wait
- Eliminates 5-10 minute wait times while maintaining quality
- **More consistent**: "Less prone to those jarring spikes" - steadier performance across tasks
- For the complex 20% of challenges, improvements become apparent

### Generative UI Features
- Designs and codes custom user interfaces in real-time, perfectly suited to prompts
- Visual layout and dynamic view available as experiments
- Google gathering feedback on these features

## Issues & Limitations

### Current Problems:
1. **Audio transcription timestamps** are significantly inaccurate
2. **File size limitations** on multimodal inputs (74MB audio failed, needed 38MB)
3. **Antigravity IDE oversight requirement** - can't be left autonomous
4. **Premature success claims** - may declare victory before verifying functionality

### Pre-Release Concerns:
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro degradation** before launch: Users reported ~50% timeout rate and poor code generation as Google likely reduced resources for training 3.0
- **Google CEO warning**: Sundar Pichai warned that AI is "prone to errors" and cautioned against blindly trusting chatbots
- **October study found** AI assistants including Gemini "routinely misrepresent news content" with 45% of answers containing at least one major issue

### Integration Issues:
- **Google Home problems persist**: Months after promised fixes, devices still struggling with basic tasks
- Subreddit dominated by complaints about formerly reliable devices
- Users say "Gemini is not a Home Assistant, and Google should not be forcing it on people until it actually is an upgrade"
